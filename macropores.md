# Macropores

## Unanswered questions
[#macropores, #permeability, #tortuosity ] 
- How does interconnectedness influence the permeability of soil (hydraulic response)
    - What is the effect of tortuosity on permeability?
    - How can we measure tortuosity? 	
	> Use a graph network to map the pore space, and use weighted (based on the width of the pore space) link to measure the shortest path between two points, normalized by the Euclidean distance between those points.
- What is the influence of distribution of macropores on the surface runoff (intrinsic permeability of the soil)
- Study how permeability changes with compaction: With and without macropores.
- How large are macropores, relative to the pore-space.
- If one achieves the same target permeability without macropores, does it matter to have macropores (i.e, is permeability the controlling factor)?
