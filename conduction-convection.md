# Thermal response (heat transfer) of soils - Conduction and Convection mechanisms 

## Unanswered questions
[#conduction-convection]
- How does the thermal response of a soil heated by a single (or a series) of cables change, when a conductive pipe is placed below the heating elements, i.e., does laws of thermal dissipation in an infinite plate buried underneath a homogeneous soil still holds?
- How does the diameter of the "highly-conductive" pipe with respect to the burial depth d/D ratio control the thermal response of soil?
